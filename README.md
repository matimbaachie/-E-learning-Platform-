# E-learning Platform

## Project Summary  
I built an E-learning Platform that allows users to browse courses, enroll, and track progress securely via Azure AD authentication.

The backend APIs are implemented in ASP.NET Core, managing courses, enrollments, and user progress with a SQL Server database through EF Core. The React frontend uses MSAL.js for authentication and offers a user-friendly course catalog and progress dashboard.

## Key Features  
- Azure AD authentication supporting multiple roles (Student, Instructor, Admin).  
- Course management: creation, editing, enrollment, and progress tracking.  
- Responsive React UI with clean navigation.  
- Secure backend RESTful APIs with Azure AD integration.  
- Azure SQL Server database with EF Core migrations.  
- Deployment to Azure App Service with CI/CD pipelines.

## Technologies Used  
- React + MSAL.js  
- ASP.NET Core Web API with Azure AD  
- Entity Framework Core + Azure SQL Database  
- Azure App Service  

## How I Delivered It  
- Setup Azure AD tenant with roles and permissions.  
- Developed database models and APIs for course and user management.  
- Implemented React frontend with authentication and routing.  
- Configured Azure App Services for hosting backend and frontend.  
- Established deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions.  
- Delivered user and developer documentation.
